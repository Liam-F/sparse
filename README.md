# Sparse and group models in portfolio optimization.
## Introduction

This code in this project is based in the models studied, analysed and proposed in the research paper, ["Sparse and Group Regression models in Portfolio Optimization"](../paper.pdf) by Alejandro Saucedo.

In this project we focus on Index Tracking, and results are measured through the Tracking Error of our models. Our main obective is to find a subset of a market index that behaces as similar as possible to this respective index.

The two main regression families that are considered in this project are sparse and group-feature regression models.

### Sparse Regression Models
* Lasso
* Feature Selection with simple models
  * Absolute Values
  * Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Optimization 
  * Norm-Constrained CVaR Optimization

### Group Regression Models
* Group Selection
* Group Lasso
* Sparse Group Lasso

## Installation
The code for this paper depends on two main libraries - namely CVX and SPAMS
